## Android ADK Challenge

<b>led-omatic ADK</b> is my submision to the II. round for the <i>Android ADK Challenge</i> for Google Developer Day 
Berlin 2011. 

### Mission
Music + Android + Arduino + Open => pure fun . 

### Block scheme
![led-omatic-block](/img/device_blok.png)

With android open accessory capable device(phone, tablet) can <b>led-o-matic ADK</b> control 
3 RGB SMD stripes independently. A desire color on any RGB stripe is achived by mixing of intensity
of basic colors on the stripe(red, green, blue). The Intesity is controlled with <i>Pulse Wide Modulation(PWM)</i>

This is extension of existing device [led-o-matic](http://ledomatic.com).

<b>led-o-matic ADK</b> is arduino MEGA based device controlled with android device over USB cable.

### Licence

<b>led-o-matic ADK</b> is open source and open hardware.

The initial work on the original device was almost completely done by geeks [team](http://ledomatic.com/team.html) 
on Google developer days boot camp in Munich, Germany in November 2010.
