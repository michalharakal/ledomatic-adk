## Software

## led-o-matic device

### arduino firmware

on arduino runs AnalogFirmata firmware without any modifications. The software is distributed with samples with Arduino IDE software.

### Seagate dockstar

Next piece of software should run on Dockstar from Seagate with openwrt as OS running on it. 
A simple python script sends html requests to server for getting a desired color a sending new analog 
values for R,G,B channels to arduino over USB with firmata protocol. But the first Seagate device didn't
stand my apemts to get OpneWrt running and 4 day before Christmas justs failed. So it was time for the plan B
and old gut NSLU2 from basement did it. 

## server
server stores required color from remote device and gets it back to the led-o-matic device on request.
The server is implemented on http protocol with RESTfull architecture, so color changes are posible 
with simple http requestests as folows:

    curl -X POST -i -d "color=ff0000" http://led-o-matic.server.com/rr/L1/RGB/0
    
## Remote clients
The first remote client was written as native code for android. But the use of simple web 
technolgies and protocol asks for writen of a cool html5 remote. Even google on the 
google devloper days 2010 didn't get the ultimative answer to th equestion native or html, so we have
written both.

## native remote client for android
This client was written already on the beging by Michael Vogt and Michael Ludwig. 
I made only minor changes before Christmas 2010.

The project waken up my interests to write for android, so i january I decided to write a new 
[client from scratch](sw_android.html)  and finally got serious reson for a new Nexus One ;-)
